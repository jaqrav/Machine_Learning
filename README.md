# Machine_Learning

The repository contains implementations of Machine Learning algorithms.

1. K Nearest Neighbors Method for film classification

The code is available in a Python notebook and script.

It uses data available under this link:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats/master/movies.csv

and is based on the Codecademy course on K Nearest Neighbors.

The algorithm can predict if a film is a good one based on its parameters, such as its year of production, budget, number of votes, revenue, runtime etc.

2. Linear Regression (LR) and Least Squares Method (LSM)

Python script presents fitting a line to toy data by using LSM and LR.
